# Big-Data-Analysis-on-Dual-Core-Sales-data
###########################################

We have used sqoop to extract the data from Dual Core database into the HDFS system.

Later, using Hive through Hue, the data is processed and analyzed. We used a polyglot system and combined files from multiple formats by creating a mediated schema. This was done on spark cluster. 

Tableau is used to visualize the final results.
